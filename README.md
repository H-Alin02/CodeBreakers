# CodeBreakers : The Revenge

## Description
The project was developed as part of the Software Engineering and Security course for the academic year 2023-2024.

Its main objective is to apply and consolidate the concepts learned during the course through the development of a game in Java, for which we chose to use the LibGDX library to facilitate the implementation of some game mechanics.

We look to the future with enthusiasm and intend to continue working on this project as it has provided us with much satisfaction.

We are also open to contributions from the community and further developments to improve and enrich the game.

## System Requirements
Java JDK <!---version X.X or higher-->
Maven <!---version X.X or higher-->
LibGDX <!---version X.X or higher-->

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/H-Alin02/CodeBreakers.git

## How to Run the Game

The game was developed using IntelliJ IDEA and Maven for dependency management and packaging. To run the game, follow these steps:

### From IntelliJ IDEA

1. Make sure you have IntelliJ IDEA installed on your system.
2. Open the project in your IDE.
3. Use Maven to package the game. You can do this by running the package or install goal from IntelliJ.
4. After packaging, locate the JAR file with dependencies in the target directory.
5. Run the game directly from IntelliJ or from the command line with the classic Java command to run a JAR:
   ```bash
   java -jar Progetto_ISS_2023-jar-with-dependencies.jar
6. For macOS, we found that to correctly run the JAR, follow these steps:
Directly from IntelliJ, click on `Run` ---> `Edit Configurations` and in `VM options` insert the command `-XstartOnFirstThread`.
This way, you can follow the previous steps and run the JAR directly from IntelliJ or by executing the following command from the terminal:
   ```bash
   java -XstartOnFirstThread -jar Progetto_ISS_2023-jar-with-dependencies.jar

## Game Screenshots

</div>

## Project Status
Currently, the game is in a DEMO stage. There was active development during the Software Engineering and Security course, but we are not actively working on it at the moment. However, future improvements and updates are not ruled out, including story expansion and the addition of English language support.
